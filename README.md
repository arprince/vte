# Terminal With Better Debug Keybindings
Press shift + PgUp and shift + pgDn to skip between the lines where commands were last entered. This is great for debugging
syntax errors in the terminal. No more scrolling up for days in order to find your error! Hope you like it!

### Install
1. download file and store folder in desired location
```
sudo ./autogen.sh
```
```
sudo make all
```
```
sudo make install
```
reboot

### Logistics
If you do not like my terminal uninstall by downloading vanilla terminal and following the above install steps in vanilla folder terminal (if something goes horribly wrong use xterm - I don't think that is a possibility though)
